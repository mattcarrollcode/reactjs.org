<Intro>

We’ve made good progress on many of the projects we covered in our [last update](https://react.dev/blog/2022/06/15/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-june-2022). We’ve learned many lessons throughout the process of working on these projects and we’re excited to share them with you!

</Intro>

*In React Labs posts, we write about ongoing research and projects in development. Though not everything in these posts may eventually ship, we want to share with you the problem spaces we’re actively thinking about, and what we’ve learned so far.*

One guiding philosophy the React team believes is in ["trusting the theory"](https://overreacted.io/what-are-the-react-team-principles/#trust-the-theory). The research we undertake is often in the pursuit of a long term theory, and we’re willing to invest the effort to get there even if it might take longer. This time around, we’re sharing more details on some of the lessons and theory that underpin these projects.

As before, this isn’t a roadmap with clear timelines, but we are hopeful that we’ll be able to continue sharing greater details on these projects with you in the coming months.

## Server Components {/*server-components*/}

React Server Components, or RSC, let you run React components entirely on the server, without ever downloading them to the client or requiring hydration. They let you use client rendering for rich interactivity while minimizing payload sizes, and also simplify your app architecture.

Since our last update, we have merged the [React Server Components RFC](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/main/text/0188-server-components.md) to ratify the proposal. We resolved outstanding issues with the [React Server Module Conventions](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/main/text/0227-server-module-conventions.md) proposal, and reached consensus with our partners to go with the `"use client"` convention. These documents also act as specification for what an RSC-compatible implementation should support.

The biggest change is that we introduced [`async` Components](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/229) as the primary way to do data fetching from Server Components. We also plan to support data loading from the client by introducing a new hook called `use` that is conceptually similar to `await`.

Now that we have data fetching pretty well sorted, we’re exploring the other direction: sending data from the client to the server, so that you can execute database mutations and implement forms. We’re doing this by letting you pass Server Functions across the server/client boundary, which the client can then call, providing seamless RPC. Server Functions also give you progressively enhanced forms as a hydration fallback.

React Server Components has shipped in [Next.js App Router](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs). This showcases a deep integration of a router that really buys into RSC as a primitive, but it's not the only way to build a RSC-compatible router and framework. There's a clear separation for features provided by the RSC spec and implementation. React Server Components is meant as a spec for components that work across compatible React frameworks.

We generally recommend using an existing framework, but if you have need to build your own custom framework, it should be possible. Building your own RSC-compatible framework is not as easy as we'd like it to be, mainly due to the deep bundler integration needed. Bundlers come with a lot of features built-in for client use that has evolved as an expected feature. We're now partnering directly with bundlers to get the primitives for RSC built-in.

## Asset Loading and Document Metadata {/*asset-loading-and-document-metadata*/}

If you use React to render your entire app, whether with Server Components or just with the new Streaming SSR capabilities of React 18, you need to have some way to manage the tags that go in the document `<head>`.  These include assets such as scripts, stylesheets, and fonts, and also document metadata such as the `<title>` tag and `<meta>` tags. In addition to these tags that go in the document `<head>`, you need a good way to pre-load images and other assets that are needed by components, all in a manner that gives a deliberate loading experience and the best possible performance.

It’s important for composition and scalability that each component define everything that it needs to work, rather than being coupled to parent components. But you don’t want each component directly manipulating the document head or fetching images directly. You want to coordinate and de-duplicate them across every component. And any `<head>` tags shouldn’t be rendered within the individual component’s output, but in the document head, which has to be streamed *first*, before the body even begins. Additionally, one of our goals is to not require components to care whether they're running on the client or the server – React should handle the details.

People have addressed this in various ways: you can render head-based tags inline in the body and then use client JavaScript to hoist them up to the head. Or you can render in two passes, doing a first pass to collect the head information and then rendering again with the stuff you collected at the top. Unfortunately this last solution isn't compatible with Streaming SSR, since it prevents you from flushing anything until you've already rendered the entire body once through. And often this metadata is used by clients that don't execute JavaScript, so the client hoisting solution isn't ideal either. We need something that works with streaming and doesn't require client code. It should also work without even rendering the component, so that assets can be pre-loaded ahead of navigations.

We’ve created a solution that addresses all of these problems in a unified way. We’re publishing an RFC soon that describes the tradeoffs of this approach and the decision-making behind it.

One area of further research is how these new capabilities might better serve CSS-in-JS libraries. We believe the solution we’ve already implemented will form a solid foundation for better interop between Server Components and CSS-in-JS. Stay tuned for future updates on that!

## React Optimizing Compiler {/*react-optimizing-compiler*/}

Since our previous update we’ve been actively iterating on the design of React Forget, an optimizing compiler for React. We’ve previously talked about it as an "auto-memoizing compiler", and that is true in some sense. But building the compiler has helped us understand React’s programming model even more deeply. A better way to understand React Forget is as an automatic *reactivity* compiler.

The core idea of React is that developers define their UI as a function of the current state. You work with plain JavaScript values — numbers, strings, arrays, objects — and use standard JavaScript idioms — if/else, for, etc — to describe your component logic. The mental model is that React will re-render whenever the application state changes. We believe this simple mental model and keeping close to JavaScript semantics is an important principle in React’s programming model.

The catch is that React can sometimes be *too* reactive: it can re-render too much. For example, in JavaScript we don’t have cheap ways to compare if two objects or arrays are equivalent (having the same keys and values), so creating a new object or array on each render may cause React to do more work than it strictly needs to. This means developers have to explicitly memoize components so as to not over-react to changes.

Our goal with React Forget is to ensure that React apps have just the right amount of reactivity by default: that apps re-render only when state values *meaningfully* change. From an implementation perspective this means automatically memoizing, but we believe that the reactivity framing is a better way to understand React and Forget. One way to think about this is that React currently re-renders when object identity changes. With Forget, React re-renders when the semantic value changes — but without incurring the runtime cost of deep comparisons.

In terms of concrete progress, since our last update we have substantially iterated on the design of the compiler to align with this automatic reactivity approach and to incorporate feedback from using the compiler internally. After some significant refactors to the compiler starting late last year, we’ve now begun using the compiler in production in limited areas at Meta. We plan to open-source it once we’ve proved it in production.

Finally, a lot of people have expressed interest in how the compiler works. We're looking forward to sharing a lot more details when we prove the compiler and open-source it. But there are a few bits we can share now:

The core of the compiler is almost completely decoupled from Babel, and the core compiler API is (roughly) old AST in, new AST out (while retaining source location data). Under the hood we use a custom code representation and transformation pipeline in order to do low-level semantic analysis. However, the primary public interface to the compiler will be via Babel and other build system plugins. For ease of testing we currently have a Babel plugin which is a very thin wrapper that calls the compiler to generate a new version of each function and swap it in.

As we refactored the compiler over the last few months, we wanted to focus on refining the core compilation model to ensure we could handle complexities such as conditionals, loops, reassignment, and mutation. However, JavaScript has a lot of ways to express each of those features: if/else, ternaries, for, for-in, for-of, etc. Trying to support the full language up-front would have delayed the point where we could validate the core model. Instead, we started with a small but representative subset of the language: let/const, if/else, for loops, objects, arrays, primitives, function calls, and a few other features. As we gained confidence in the core model and refined our internal abstractions, we expanded the supported language subset. We're also explicit about syntax we don't yet support, logging diagnostics and skipping compilation for unsupported input. We have utilities to try the compiler on Meta's codebases and see what unsupported features are most common so we can prioritize those next. We'll continue incrementally expanding towards supporting the whole language.

Making plain JavaScript in React components reactive requires a compiler with a deep understanding of semantics so that it can understand exactly what the code is doing. By taking this approach, we’re creating a system for reactivity within JavaScript that lets you write product code of any complexity with the full expressivity of the language, instead of being limited to a domain specific language.

## Offscreen Rendering {/*offscreen-rendering*/}

Offscreen rendering is an upcoming capability in React for rendering screens in the background without additional performance overhead. You can think of it as a version of the [`content-visiblity` CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content-visibility) that works not only for DOM elements but React components, too. During our research, we've discovered a variety of use cases:

- A router can prerender screens in the background so that when a user navigates to them, they're instantly available.
- A tab switching component can preserve the state of hidden tabs, so the user can switch between them without losing their progress.
- A virtualized list component can prerender additional rows above and below the visible window.
- When opening a modal or popup, the rest of the app can be put into "background" mode so that events and updates are disabled for everything except the modal.

Most React developers will not interact with React's offscreen APIs directly. Instead, library developers will integrate offscreen rendering into their components, and your router and UI will automatically take advantage of the capability.

The idea is that you should be able to render any React tree offscreen without changing the way you write your components. When a component is rendered offscreen, it does not actually *mount* until the component becomes visible — its effects are not fired. For example, if a component uses `useEffect` to log analytics when it appears for the first time, prerendering won't mess up the accuracy of those analytics. Similarly, when a component goes offscreen, its effects are unmounted, too. A key feature of offscreen rendering is that you can toggle the visibility of a component without losing its state.

Since our last update, we’ve tested an experimental version of prerendering internally at Meta in our React Native apps on Android and iOS, with positive performance results. We've also improved how offscreen rendering works with Suspense — suspending inside a offscreen tree will not trigger Suspense fallbacks. Our remaining work involves finalizing the primitives that are exposed to library developers. We expect to publish an RFC later this year, alongside an experimental API for testing and feedback.


## Transition Tracing {/*transition-tracing*/}

The Transition Tracing API lets you detect when React transitions become slower and to investigate why they may be slow. Following our last update, we have completed the initial design of the API and published an [RFC](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/238). The basic capabilities have also been implemented. The project is currently on hold. We welcome feedback on the RFC and look forward to resuming its development to provide a better performance measurement tool for React transitions.
